The sleep.hex file is used to initialise the FPGA On-Chip RAM used for
the HPS instruction memory.

Do not delete or change this file. The HPSWrapper has different software
requirements to the LeedsSoCComputer. Without these special initialisation
routines, the UART and DDR interfaces will not work.
